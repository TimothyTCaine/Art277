   <h2>Re: Albert Momo university application</h2> 
   <hr> 
   <p>Dear Mr. Momo,</p>
   <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at Starz University's science faculty to study<br>as part of your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosphy">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p> 
   <h2>Starting dates</h2> 
   <p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would siut<br>us better if you could start at the begeinning of a semester, the start dates for each one are as<br>follows:</p> 
   <p>First semester: 9 October 2022<br>Second semester: 15 January 2023<br>Third semester: 2 May 2023</p> 
   <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p> 
   <p>You can find more information about important university dates on our website</p> 
   <h2>Subjects of study</h2> 
   <p>At the Starz University, we have a pretty open-minded research facility__as long as the subjects<br>fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. you seem like an intelligent, dedicated<br>researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas<br>you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follow, in order of priority:</p> 
   <p>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)<br> Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30&deg;C (86&#8457;).<br>when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3x10<sup>4</sup> increasing 3x10<sup>4</sup>.) 
    <p>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</p> 
    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd<br>expect the research to take, required staff and other resoureces, and anything else you think we'd<br>need to know? Thanks.</p> 
    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2> 
    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post_doctrate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To<br>answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p> 
    <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt> 
    <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village<br>would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd> 
    <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt> 
    <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice<br>this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling<br>their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow<br>students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as twerking.</dd> 
    <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt> 
    <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s<br>believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robot", stilted<br>movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on<br>however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really<br>cold.</dd> 
    <p>For more of my research, see my exotic dance research page.</p> 
    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
